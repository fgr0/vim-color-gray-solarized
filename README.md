Gray Solarized Colorscheme for Vim
==================================

*Solarized just had to much blue.*

**Gray Solarized** is an adaption of the famous [Solarized][] Colorscheme by
Ethan Schoonover, where the bluish background colors have been substituted for
a grayscale palett. 

## Differences to the original Scheme

The color palett has been substituted for the following:

```
name       solarized         gray_solarized
           hex       xterm   hex       xterm
--------   --------  -----   --------  -----
base03     #002b36     234   #222222     233
base02     #073642     235   #262626     234
base01     #586e75     240   #4e4e4e      59 
base00     #657b83     241   #585858     240
base0      #839496     244   #909090     246

orange     #cb4b16     166   #cb4b16     166
red        #dc322f     160   #dc322f     124
magenta    #d33682     125   #d33682     125
violet     #6c71c4      61   #6c71c4      61 
blue       #268bd2      33   #268bd2      33 
cyan       #2aa198      37   #2aa198      37 
green      #859900      64   #859900      64 
```

Also, the options have been removed, simply because I personally had
no need for them and did not know how to adjust the values for my scheme.

### Airline Theme
Along with the colorscheme comes a theme for [airline][]
